axon server connection failed:
* have the lates axon server dependency
* when u start the axon server, go to browser for the first time before starting spring boot,
click the start single node or something to go to the dashboard. it ensures the axon is fully 
initialized and ready to connect to spring boot.
* now start the spring boot.
* if you have changed the axon server port, then change it itn the spring boot too.
